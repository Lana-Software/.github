## About us

We are a small team of Colombian independent developers, creating applications that enhance the lives of our users (or at least that's what we like to think).

devteam:
- [Duvan Espinal Arboleda](https://github.com/DuvanArwenLazar), the fucking leader (He doesn't do shit).
- [Juan Pablo Morales](https://github.com/Kolozuz), professional translator (milf tester).
- [John Steban Lopez](https://github.com/JohnGolgota), he is never there when we need him.
